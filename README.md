# üêà AffiliCats

A Progressive Web App demo that showcases various **flaky network resilience measures**.

The core idea is to simulate an affiliate or comparison app with various API calls
(*e.g.*, for prices, stars, reviews, location, photos) proxied by dummy *lorem ipsum* type APIs
where the conversion action is to click through to a third-party and place the affiliate cookie
(that's the click the app never wants to lose).

## Demo

Play with the app at
üëâ [googlechromelabs.github.io/affilicats](https://googlechromelabs.github.io/affilicats/) üëà.

## Developing and Building

You can develop in the `/src` folder while you work on the app locally. Lint your code via `npm run lint`.

The app is remotely [deployed from the `/docs` folder](https://help.github.com/articles/configuring-a-publishing-source-for-github-pages/#publishing-your-github-pages-site-from-a-docs-folder-on-your-master-branch).
You can build to there by running `npm run build`.

## Things to try

- **Use the app under ideal conditions:**
  You should be able to freely click and browse around, content should always lazy-load.
- **Search for something:**
  You should be able to search for anything that has a [Wikimedia Commons category page](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Topics) with images, for example, "[Elephants](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Elephants)".
- **Load while offline:**
  You should see skeleton content and fallback images.
- **Regain connection:**
  You should see the app hydrate and load content.
- **Lose connection while browsing:**
  You should see the offline note and be no longer able to search. When you scroll and click around, fallback content should be shown.
- **Click through to "View Deal" while offline:**
  You should always‚Äîoffline or not‚Äîbe able to click through and see a countdown (paused if already offline, pausing if losing connection).
- **Regain connection on the forward page:**
  The countdown should start or resume and you should be redirected to the landing page.
- **Use an ultra slow network:**
  You should see timeout placeholders (a little clock icon) and info text for timed-out requests.
